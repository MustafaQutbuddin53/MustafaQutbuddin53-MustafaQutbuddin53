## Projects

### Project # 1: Data Manipulation and Visualization

- **Description**:

This project focused on analyzing a AsiaCup dataset sourced from Kaggle, comprising of seven tables with over 250 rows in the primary table. The objective was to demonstrate proficiency in SQL, Excel, and Power BI through comprehensive data manipulation and visualization.

Phase 1: Data Preparation and SQL Analysis
The dataset underwent thorough profiling using Pandas Profiling to identify and resolve any data quality issues. After cleaning, the data was loaded into SQL for further analysis. SQL joins were utilized to establish relationships between tables, and at least three Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were derived to provide meaningful insights from the dataset.

Phase 2: Excel Visualization and Analysis
Data from SQL was seamlessly imported into Excel for detailed analysis. Three additional KPIs were formulated using advanced Excel formulas such as COUNTIFS, SUMIFS, and VLOOKUP. Pivot tables and charts were created in Excel to visualize and interpret the dataset's insights effectively.

Phase 3: Power BI Dashboard Development
All KPIs—three from SQL and three from Excel—were integrated into Power BI. Three additional KPIs were formulated in Power BI using measures. A comprehensive dashboard was designed in Power BI, showcasing nine visualizations that highlighted key insights from the dataset.

### Project # 2: Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting

- **Description**:
The project aimed to forecast store sales for the Fall 2023 season using a store's sales dataset. By leveraging machine learning techniques such as Linear Regression and Decision Tree Models, sales predictions were made based on various factors like promotions, holidays, events, income proxies, and day of the week.

Phase 1: Data Exploration and Preparation 
In this phase, the team conducted an in-depth exploration of the dataset to understand the variables and their relationships. They cleaned the data, handled missing values, and performed feature engineering to create new variables that could potentially impact sales predictions. Additionally, they conducted descriptive statistics and data auditing to ensure data quality.

Phase 2: Model Building and Evaluation 
During this phase, the team implemented supervised machine learning techniques, including Linear Regression and Decision Tree Models, to build predictive models for store sales. They analyzed the impact of variables like promotions, holidays, and oil prices on sales predictions. Model evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) were used to assess the performance of the models.

Phase 3: Recommendations and Future Scope 
In the final phase, the team interpreted the results of the predictive models and provided recommendations based on the insights gained. They identified potential changes in existing variables that could improve sales forecasting accuracy and suggested new variables that could be included in future analyses. Additionally, they outlined the scope for further work, such as expanding the dataset or incorporating hierarchical time series analysis for more robust predictions.

By following these three phases, the project provided valuable insights into store sales forecasting for the Fall 2023 season, helping "Favorita" retail stores make informed decisions to optimize their sales strategies.
